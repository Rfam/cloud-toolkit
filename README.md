# Rfam Cloud toolkit

A collection of terraform/ansible configurations to deploy cloud infrastructure.

This code creates the NFS filesystem used in the [Rfam Cloud](https://rfam.org/cloud). It is used together with the kubernetes infrastructure created by KubeNow and used to run the code in [rfam-family-building/kubernetes](https://github.com/Rfam/rfam-family-pipeline/tree/master/kubernetes).
